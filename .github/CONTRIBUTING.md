Close enough, you get the point, right?

We strongly encourage contributing to our projects at Howell IT! While coding is the most obvious way to contribute, its definitely not the only way.

## Prereqs

You must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

## Submitting an issue

The fundamental block of contributing is to first submit an issue. This can be anything from a bug to a feature that you think should be added. You don't need to know how to fix or complete your issue to be able to submit it.

Essentially, if you see something, say something!

## Make your changes

Follow the [Unofficial PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle).

Any commits you make should also be full of good explanation.
